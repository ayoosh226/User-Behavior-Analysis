# User Behavior Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes user behavior based on a dataset containing various user-related metrics, including app usage, screen time, and device information. The primary goal is to explore relationships between different user behaviors and demographics, specifically focusing on gender differences in app usage.

## Features
- **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load the dataset and perform initial data exploration to understand its structure and contents.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct a thorough EDA using visualizations to uncover insights into user behavior patterns.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Compute means and correlations to identify relationships between numerical features.
- **Visualizations**: Create various plots (histograms, scatter plots, count plots) to illustrate findings.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is named `user_behavior_dataset.csv`. It contains user behavior data, including:
- Device Model
- Operating System
- Gender
- App Usage Time (min/day)
- Screen On Time (hours/day)
- Battery Drain (mAh/day)
- Number of Apps Installed
- Data Usage (MB/day)

## Findings
- The analysis revealed that both genders use the internet equally, as evidenced by similar app usage and screen time.
- Count analysis showed that most users prefer Android OS over iOS.
- The correlation matrix indicated strong relationships among app usage time, screen on time, battery drain, number of apps installed, and data usage.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to analyze user behavior data and extract meaningful insights. The visualizations and statistical analyses provide a clear understanding of how different user demographics interact with technology.
